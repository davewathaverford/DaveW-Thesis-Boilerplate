abstract = {Simplicity and visibility are two important characteristics of programming languages for
novices. Novices start programming with very little idea of the properties of the notional machine
implied by the language they are learning. To help them learn these properties, the notional machine
should be simple. That is, it should consist of a small number of parts that interact in ways that
can be easily understood, possibly by analogy to other mechanisms with which the novice is more familiar.
A notional machine is the idealized model of the computer implied by the constructs of the programming
language. Visibility is concerned with methods for viewing selected parts and processes of this
notional machine in action. We introduce the term “commentary” which is the system's dynamic
characterization of the notional machine, expressed in either text or pictures on the user's terminal.
We examine the simplicity and visibility of three systems, each designed to provide programming experience
to different populations of novices.}

The context for this work centres on an introductory undergraduate course and a postgraduate course. Both these courses are taught by distance education. These courses both use Smalltalk as an introduction to object technology. More particularly, the undergraduate course uses Smalltalk as a first programming language.Distance education can limit the amount and speed of individual feedback that can be given in the early stages of learning. For this reason, particular attention has been paid to characterizing measures for avoiding elementary misconceptions seen in beginning learners. At the same time we also address some misconceptions observed in postgraduate students. The pedagogical issues discussed are of particular importance when devising an extended series of examples for teaching or assessment, or when designing a visual microworld to be used for teaching purposes.},

abstract = {This study focuses on CS minor students' decisions to drop out from the CS1 course. The high level of drop out percentage has been a problem at Helsinki University of Technology for many years. This course has yearly enrolment of 500-600 students and the drop out percentage has varied from 30-50 percents.Since we did not have clear picture of drop out reasons we conducted a qualitative interview research in which 18 dropouts from the CS1 course were interviewed. The reasons of drop out were categorized and, in addition, each case was investigated individually. This procedure enabled us to both list the reasons and to reveal the cumulative nature of drop out reasons.The results indicate that several reasons affect students' decision to quit the CS1 course. The most frequent reasons were the lack of time and the lack of motivation. However, both of these reasons were in turn affected by factors, such as the perceived difficulty of the course, general difficulties with time managing and planning studies, or the decision to prefer something else. Furthermore, low comfort level and plagiarism played a role in drop out. In addition, drop out reasons cumulated.This study shows that the complexity and large variety of factors involved in students' decision to drop the course. This indicates that simple actions to improve teaching or organization on a CS1 course to reduce drop out may be ineffective. Efficient intervention to the problem apparently requires a combination of many different actions that take into consideration the versatile nature of reasons involved in drop out.},

abstract = {Students' understanding of object-oriented (OO) program execution was studied by asking students to draw a picture of a program state at a specific moment. Students were given minimal instructions on what to include in their drawings in order to see what they considered to be central concepts and relationships in program execution. Three drawing tasks were given at different phases of an elementary OO programming course where two animation tools were used for program visualization. The drawings were analyzed for their overall approaches and their detailed contents.There was a large variability in the overall approaches and the popularity of various approaches changed during the course. The results indicate that students' mental representations of OO concepts and program execution not only grow as new material is covered in teaching, but they also change. The first drawings treat methods as having primarily a static existence; later methods are seen as dynamic invocations that call each other. The role of classes in program execution fluctuates during learning, indicating problems in locating the notion of class with respect to, for example, objects. Two major sources of problems that manifested in many different forms were the relationship between object and method, and the role of the main method with respect to program state. Other problems were caused by overly simplistic understanding of object identification and improper use of application domain knowledge.},

Students rarely included any mention of the hardware/software context of programs, their users, or their real-world domains. Students do mention inheritance, but not encapsulation or abstraction.

After fifteen years of using C++ for both CS1 and CS2, the Computer Science Department
at Michigan State University changed the CS1 course to Python. This paper examines
the impact of that change on the second course in the sequence, CS2, which kept C++
as its primary language. We report results on a CS2 class which had a mixture of students
who had used either C++ or Python from our CS1 course. The CS2 class covered the same
topics as previously, though with some changes, and even gave the same final exam
as a previous offering. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare students
from the Python group with students from the non-Python group on three outcomes: final
exam grade, programming projects scores, and final grade for the course. The main
result was that there were no significant differences between the groups for all three
outcomes. In addition, multiple regression analysis showed that students' past performance
(overall GPA) in the University predicted final grades, final exam scores, and programming
project scores for the course, but there was no effect of the programming language
feature: Python or non-Python. We feel this shows that the Python-based CS1 course
prepared students for the C++-based CS2 course as well as the C++-based CS1 course
did---while exposing them to a different, powerful and useful language.},

abstract = {If you change the CS1 language to Python, what is the impact on the rest of the curriculum?
In earlier work we examined the impact of changing CS1 from C++ to Python while leaving
CS2 in C++. We found that Python-prepared CS1 students fared no differently in CS2
than students whose CS1 course was in C++, even though CS2 was taught in C++ and covered
the same topics as in previous years. Was that an anomaly? What happens in the next
tier of courses? When our CS1 was first changed to Python there were many students
who had taken CS1 in C++ still in the system. The result is that there is a cadre
of students with either CS1 in Python or CS1 in C++ moving together through our curriculum.
This one-time occurrence is an opportunity to study the students with many variables
fixed. Our next tier of courses is a C-based computer organization course, a C++ based
object-oriented software design course, and a data structures course. We found that
the students who started with Python fared as well as the CS1 C++ students. As before,
the best predictor of performance was their college GPA. Python versus C++ CS1 preparation
was not a predictor of performance in any course. We conclude again that in our C++
based curriculum changing CS1 to Python had no negative impact on student performance
and did not require any significant change in those subsequent courses.},

abstract = {Mental models of recursion provide some idea into a student's understanding of recursion. However there has been concern regarding whether viable trace mental models of recursion show students' true understanding of recursion. We have conducted an investigation to further examine the understanding of recursion of students with viable trace mental models. The investigation looked at students' understanding of the termination of a recursive function, their descriptive mental models and their ability to generate a recursive function. This research provides evidence to show that trace methods are essentially mechanical processes that can allow students with little understanding of recursion to correctly evaluate a recursive function but that students do not fully understand recursion and in particular have difficulties with the passive flow. Based on the results of the study, this paper discusses possible changes that can be made to our teaching in order to more eectively teach recursion to first year students.},

that have contributed to our understanding of the challenges that novice programmers
face when learning about the runtime dynamics of programs and the role of the computer
in program execution. More specifically, the review covers the literature on programming
misconceptions, the cognitive theory of mental models, constructivist theory of knowledge
and learning, phenomenographic research on experiencing programming, and the theory
of threshold concepts. These bodies of work are examined in relation to the concept
of a “notional machine”—an abstract computer for executing programs of a particular
kind. As a whole, the literature points to notional machines as a major challenge
in introductory programming education. It is argued that instructors should acknowledge
the notional machine as an explicit learning objective and address it in teaching.
Teaching within some programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, may
benefit from using multiple notional machines at different levels of abstraction.
Pointers to some promising pedagogical techniques are provided.},

abstract = {The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) technique is nowadays the most popular programming technique among tertiary education institutions. However, learning OOP is a cognitively demanding task for undergraduate students. Several difficulties and misconceptions have been recorded in the literature for both OOP concepts and languages, mainly Java. This article focuses on reviewing and advancing research on the most fundamental OOP concepts, namely, the concepts of “object” and “class” and their role during program execution. The results of a long-term investigation on the subject are presented, focusing on a study exploring undergraduate students’ conceptions on “objects” and “classes.” The study advances related research on categories of conceptions on “objects” and “classes” by providing quantitative results, in addition to qualitative results, regarding the frequency of the recorded conceptions. Nearly half the students seem to comprehend the modeling and static/dynamic aspects of the concepts “object” and “class.” Implications for achieving a deep conceptual understanding of text, action, and modeling aspects of these fundamental concepts are also discussed. Information regarding the programming environments utilized in the course and key features of the applied teaching approach are presented, in order to facilitate both a better understanding of the context and a better employment of the results of the presented study. Finally, proposals for enhancing the contribution of this and similar studies are made.},

abstract = {Research in the area of Computer Science (CS) education, has focused on identifying the reasons that students do not finish their studies in CS. Although there is increasing demand for CS professionals, there is not enough knowledge to explain the high dropout rates in CS education. This study aims to empirically examine how students' intention to complete their studies (retention) in CS is affected by variables playing a key role in higher education. By identifying which variables contribute to dropout in CS studies, we will be able to focus on how to improve aspects related with them in order to reduce dropout rates. To do so we identified the following variables: Year of studies, Gender, Age, Students' Effort, Absence from Classes, Expected Grade point average (GPA), and Current GPA, and tested their effect on retention, based on the responses collected from 241 CS student. Year of studies and Effort have positive effects on students' intention to finish their studies in CS. Interestingly, the expected GPA has a negative effect on students' intentions to finish their studies. The findings contribute to theory and practice, as they offer CS educators and policy makers insights that may aid towards increased student retention and reduced dropout rates.},

abstract = {Many teachers of CS 1 (introductory programming) have switched to Python rather than C, C++, or Java. One reason is the belief that Python's interpreted nature plus simpler syntax and semantics ease a student's learning, but data supporting that belief is scarce. This paper addresses the question: Do Python learners struggle less than C++ learners? We analyzed student submissions on small coding exercises in CS 1 courses at 20 different universities, 10 courses using Python, and 11 using C++. Each course used either the Python or C++ version of an online textbook from one publisher, each book having 100+ small coding exercises, expected to take 2-5 minutes each. We considered 11 exercises whose Python and C++ versions were nearly identical and that appeared in various chapters. We defined struggle rate for exercises, where struggle means a student spent excessive time or attempts on an exercise. Based on that rate, we found the learning for Python was not eased; in fact, Python students had significantly higher struggle rates than C++ students (26\% vs. 13\%). Higher rates were seen even when considering only classes with no prerequisites, classes for majors only, or classes for non-majors only. We encourage the community to do further analyses, to help guide teachers when choosing a CS 1 language.},

Some subjects in physics, maths or computing seem to be difficult by nature.
Teachers test many ways to help student learn these subjects. In Computer Programming
the approach seems to be using higher-level languages, concepts and abstractions.
It seems reasonable that languages similar to human language can ease the task of
computer programming. Similar ideas are explored in other subjects. However, this
seems contradictory with the way we construct knowledge: lower-level concepts support
the development of higher-level ones. Is it possible to master higher-level concepts
without previously mastering lower-level ones?"

abstract = {We performed a controlled experiment comparing a C and a Python Introductory Programming course. Three faculty members at University of Campinas, Brazil, taught the same CS1 course for the same majors in two different semesters, one version in Python and one in C, with a total of 391 students involved in the experiment. We measured the dropout rate, the failure rate, the grades on the two exams, the proportion of completed lab assignments, and the number of submissions per completed assignment. There was no difference in the dropout rate. The failure rate for Python was 16.9% against 23.1% for C. The effect size (Cohen’s D) on the comparison of Python against C on the midterm exam was 0.27, and 0.38 for the final exam. The effect size for the proportion of completed assignments was 0.39 and the effect size for the number of submissions per assignment was -0.61 (Python had less submissions per completed assignments). Thus, for all measures, with the exception of dropout rate, the version of the course in Python yielded better student outcomes than the version in C and all differences are significant (with 95% confidence) with the exception of the failure rate (p-value=0.12).},
